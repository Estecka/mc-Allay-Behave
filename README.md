# Allay, behaveÂ !

An allay Quality of Life mod

## Features

### Allay calling:
Allays who like you can be called to your side, either by crouching while looking at them, or by typing their name in the chat.

Called allays will follow you closely for a few second, or so long as you maintain eye contact. For that duration, you can take their item away, and they willl remain close. They will forget their liked note-block, and won't be distracted by nearby items or other note-blocks.

Once you're done with them, you can send them off early using LMB.

### Other tweaks:
- Allays can be pushed around by their liked player using LMB.  
  No more sitting where you're trying to build.
- (_Requires clientside_) Allays can no longer push their liked player around when colliding.  
  No more pushing you off a cliff.
- Allays will aim a little higher when giving items to a player.  
  No more trying to give you items through the floor.
