# Allay, behaveÂ !

An allay Quality of Life mod

## Features
- (_Requires clientside_) Allays can no longer push their liked player around when colliding.
- Allays will aim a little higher when giving items to a player; no more attempts at giving you items through the floor.
- Allays can be pushed around by their liked player using LMB.
- Tamed allays can be called to your side by crouch-staring.  
Called allays will follow you closely for a few second, or so long as you maintain eye contact; they will stay close even after taking their item away.
Called allays forget their liked note-block, and won't be distracted by nearby items or other note-blocks.   
You can send them off early using LMB.
