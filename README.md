# Allay, behaveÂ !

An allay Quality of Life mod

## Features

### Allay calling:
Allays who like you can be called to your side, either by crouching while looking at them, or by typing their name in the chat.

Called allays will follow you closely for a few second, or so long as you maintain eye contact. For that duration, they will remain close even if you take their item away. They will forget their liked note-block, and won't be distracted by nearby.

Calling an allay by sight requires precisely positioning the crosshair on the allay, but maintaining eye contact afterward is much more forgiving. You'll only need to look into their general direction, so you can easily keep multiple allays at your heel..

Once you're done with them, you can send them off early using LMB.

### Other tweaks:
- **Allays can be pushed around by their liked player using LMB.** This helps removing them from places where you're trying to build.
- (_Requires clientside_) **Allays can no longer push other players around when colliding.** This prevents them from pushing you off the edge of a block, or offsetting your croshair right as you're about to interact with something.
- **Allays will aim a little higher when giving items to a player.** This prevents them from trying to give you items through the floor.
